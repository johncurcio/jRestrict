## What is it?

jRestrict is a domain specific language built to restrict ``.java`` files into using only what's specified in a simple ``.jstrict`` script.  With jRestrict you can **prohibit** clauses from being used, **require** that a list of clauses is used or **enclose** your java file to a list of clauses. 

### Syntax

The syntax for a jscript file is composed of four main commands: 

```markdown
files {
  # here comes a list of files that will be validated by jRestrict
}
requires {
  # here comes a list of clauses that should be on every java file specified in files{}
}
encloses {
  # here comes a list of clauses that encloses all clauses which can be used in the java files
}
prohibits {
  # here comes a list of clauses that cannot be used in the java files
}
```
